# Logging Migration Plan Audit (001)

Date: 2025-09-15
Scope: Verify implementation status against docs/plan/logging/001-migration-plan.md

## Summary
- Overall: Migration is effectively complete at code level. Final API (`infra/logging/logger.dart`) is widely adopted.
- Residuals: Only two false-positive matches inside a doc string and one commented import line trigger the acceptance grep commands.

## What I Checked
- YataLogger facade usage: `rg -n "YataLogger\\." lib` → 0 hits
- Message API calls: `rg -n "\\blog(Info|Warning|Error|Debug)Message\\(" lib` → 2 hits (doc string only)
- Compat shortcuts: `rg -n "\\b(logInfo|logDebug|logWarning|logError)\\(" lib` → 0 hits
- Compat imports: `rg -n "import .*compat\\.dart|import .*yata_logger\\.dart" lib` → 1 hit (commented)
- LoggerComponent: `rg -n " with LoggerComponent\\b" lib` → 0 hits
- Final API presence: `lib/infra/logging/logger.dart` exposes `t/d/i/w/e/f` + `withTag`

## Findings by Plan Phase

1) Phase 1 — Remove `YataLogger.*`
- Status: Completed.
- Evidence: No occurrences across `lib`. Compat files `core/logging/yata_logger.dart` are gone.

2) Phase 2 — Replace `log*Message(...)`
- Status: Completed in code; two documentation-only examples remain.
- Details: Matches are inside a triple-quoted doc string in `lib/core/constants/log_enums/enhanced_log_enums.dart:43` and `:47`.
- Note: The current acceptance command will still flag these; consider excluding this file or changing the example.

3) Phase 3 — Remove compat shortcuts (`logInfo/logDebug/...`)
- Status: Completed.
- Details: No occurrences. Code calls `log.i/w/d/e/f(...)` via `import ".../logger.dart" as log;` or uses top-level `i/w/e` in `lib/main.dart`.
- Tagging: Implemented via inline `tag:` parameter (e.g., `"SupabaseClientService"`, `serviceName`). This satisfies the plan’s “inline or withTag” policy.

4) Phase 4 — Delete compat layer
- Status: Completed.
- Details: `lib/core/logging/compat.dart`, `.../yata_logger.dart`, and `LoggerComponent` are absent. One commented import line remains:
  - lib/infra/repositories/base_repository.dart:7 `// import "../../core/logging/compat.dart";`
- Note: The acceptance grep flags this comment; removing the dead comment or refining the grep would make the checklist pass cleanly.

## Additional Notes
- Final API (`withTag`, `t/d/i/w/e/f`, dynamic config, crash capture) exists in `lib/infra/logging/logger.dart` and appears integrated across features.
- `flutter analyze` not executed in this audit. Recommend running locally to fully satisfy plan’s acceptance.

## Suggested Follow-ups (Non-blocking)
- Adjust acceptance commands or docs examples to avoid false positives:
  - Exclude `lib/core/constants/log_enums/enhanced_log_enums.dart` from the Phase 2 grep, or rewrite examples to use `log.i(...)` or `i(...)` syntax.
  - Delete the commented compat import in `lib/infra/repositories/base_repository.dart:7`.
- Optional: Encourage class-level `withTag('ClassName')` guards where stable tags are desired; current inline `tag:` usage is acceptable per plan.
